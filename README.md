# BackgroundGenerator
A background generator that takes two colors selected by the user and creates CSS code to be input into a stylesheet. 

Without CSS code:

With CSS code:

In addition to the color picker, I created a function that sets the gradient colors and speaks to the css in the DOM. This edits the color values seen on screen using Javascript and then updates from the method textContent, the text seen to the code needed to copy and paste the gradient into your style sheet.
