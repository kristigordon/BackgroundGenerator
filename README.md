# BackgroundGenerator
I've created a background generator that takes two colors selected by the user and creates CSS code to be input into a stylesheet. This creates one of the gradients seen below. 

Without CSS code:

With CSS code:

In addition to the color picker, I created a function that sets the gradient colors and speaks to the css in the DOM. This edits the color values seen on screen using Javascript and then updates from the method textContent, the text seen to the code needed to copy and paste the gradient into your style sheet.

This program was used to help with my portfolio site as you can see in a few of these gradients.

And this is the program being used to style this machine learning site I created that recognizes faces in a given picture provided by the user.
